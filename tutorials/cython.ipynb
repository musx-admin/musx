    "# Optimizing instruments with Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to convert a \"pure Python\" instrument -- an instrument defined within a python environment such as a .py script or this running notebook -- into a C-compiled instrument that can run significantly faster.  It should be noted that in many cases pure Python instruments run fast enough to not need optimization. However, if instruments are complex, or require 'expensive' unit generators, the time it takes to render the audio file can become an impediment to the project at hand. In cases like this it makes sense to clone the instrument source code to a new file, compile that file down to a C shared library using Python's [Cython compiler](https://cython.org/), and import the optimized instrument into the Python.\n",

In the command line below, the `--3str` argument informs Cython that the file is Python3 and `--inline` places the newly compiled instrurment (a C shared library) in the same directory as the .pyx file.
