    "The purpose of this notebook is twofold: to understand how [mapping](mapping.ipynb) can be applied to non-musical equations, and to demonstrate how *sonification* can reveal the behavior of non-musical functions.  The term sonification means to use an acoustic signal to perceive information inherent in a collection of data [Cramer]. Sonification is to the ear what graphic plotting is to the eye -- a way to understand relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to perceive. Our ears are very keen instruments that can detect subtle, multidimensional changes in sound space. We are probably all familiar with listening to small fluxations in sound in order to detect the source of a mechanical problem. Sonification can yield information about regularity, overall shape, grouping, transitions, and deviations in data that present in an acoustic signal.\n",

    "The term *deterministic chaos* refers to the behavior of systems that are not random but are nevertheless unpredictable in nature. The physical world is filled with complex dynamic processes such as turbulence and weather that are not random but whose behavior is nevertheless impossible to predict. There are several features that characterize these systems. First, chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions -- in one initial arrangement their elements produces periodicity; in another, closely proximate arrangement, complete unpredictability ensues. This is because chaotic system are nonlinear, which means that changes in one element do not produce a like, or equivalent change in others. Because of nonlinearity, cause and effect relationships are not proportional in a chaotic system, so that two functions for a single equation may evolve in a similar way but can then suddenly diverge into different paths:"

    "\n",
    "The behavior of the logistic map does not depend on the value of f0 alone but also on the constant c. In fact, for numerous values of c, f0 doesn't matter much at all since the function will converge eventually. Most obviously, setting c=0 yields zero values for all values of fn for n>0. (Figure 4) Similar behavior results for all values of c<~3.0. At this point, the map converges to several attractors again, depending on the value of the initial f0. It converges first to 2, then to 4, 8, 16 ... attractors until it reaches chaotic behavior. (This repeated doubling within families of functions such as the logistic map has been first noted and extensively studied by the physicist Mitchell J. Feigenbaum.) Interestingly, the sequence of functions of the logistic map traverse several states of temporary tranquility on their way to sheer chaotic behavior . Thus, fn is actually a family of functions of the form y(s,c) = c * y * (1 - y), with seed values s = {0.0005, 0.001 ... 1.0}. Although the logistic map may give radically different numerical sequences for any two functions of the same family (functions with equal c but differing seed value s) the distribution pattern of a family after i iterations and the histogram of any of its functions up to the ith iteration approach the same attractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This animation shows a sequence of iterations from 0 through 560, using 1000 initial seed values. Note a) how each iteration adds a new sinusoidal branch to the attractor and b) how each new branch is limited by its neighboring branches. Note, too, how distinctly chaotic and non-chaotic areas of attraction coexist as the number of iterations increases. The repeated doubling of attractors within families of functions such as the logistic map was first noted and extensively studied by the physicist Mitchell J. Feigenbaum."
