    "In musx, a *composer* is a Python [generator](https://stackabuse.com/python-generators/) (function) that executes inside a time-based scheduler to add musical material to a score. A composer's implementation code often follows a common format as shown in this schematic:\n",

    "This template reveals that a composer generator provides at least one input parameter to receive the musical score, followed by any number of additional optional parameters according to the needs of the designer. The second line indicates that when the composer is called it can create whaever internal state variables it needs in place in order to add content to the score. The main body of the composer is typically represented by a python for loop that iterates to add musical events to the score and crucially yields back a *time delta* in seconds that informs the controlling scheduler how long the composer should wait before running again. If the composer stops yielding (i.e. the for loop has ended), or if the yield value is negative, then the scheduler will not insert the composer back into score and it will terminate.  After the for loop complete, the composer can optionally perform finalizations,  that \"clean up\" or take final actions just before the composer is terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple composer functions can run at the same time, and composer functions can *sprout* (add) other composer functions to the scheduler dynamically, as needed.\n",
    "One way to think about a composer is that it represents a unique *time line* that runs in order to add material to a musical score. As such, it is always evaluated within the context of the score's *scheduler*, a time-based priority queue that represents the flow of musical time in the composition. The scheduler also provides several attributes that composers can use to find out the current runtime state of the score. \n",
