    "## Musx channel tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the above example, working with pitch bends directly can be rather unwieldy! To help facilitate working with non 12-TET tunings musx provides two features that, when used together, allow composers to more easily approximate true microtonal scales and tunings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first feature is musx's floating point key numbers *kkk.cc* where *kkk* is the midi key number and *cc* is interpreted as cents above the midi key *kkk*. For example, the keynum 60.5 specifies a pitch that is 50 cents (one quarter-tone) above the equal tempered tuning. Since a semitone is 100 cents, any microtonal value can be encoded as a floating point keynum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature, called *channel tuning*, implements a fixed, microtonal setup for an entire midi file. Microtuning is activated by using the *microdivs* argument to *metatrack()*. The microdivs option quantizes the semitone into some number of micro-divisions. The default value for *microdivs* is 1, which means that the semitone is divided by 1, so no microtonal output occurs. However, if microdivs is 2 then semitone/2 = 50 cent quantization (quartertone tuning), and so on. The maxmimum number for microdivs is 16, or 6.25 cents, which is very close to the frequency limen of ~5 cents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Channel tuning works by claiming certain channels to use for microtonal inflection. For example, if microdivs is 2 then channel tuning claims successive *pairs* of channels for quarter-tone tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "channels:      | chan0 | chan1 | chan2 | chan3 | ... |\n",
    "---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|\n",
    "tuning (cents):| 0     | 50    | 0     | 50    | ... |\n",
    "instrument:    | flute | flute | viola | viola | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the channels available for different instruments are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, and the channels 1 3 5 6 9 11 13 15 are automatically assigned the same instrument as their left side channel but tuned one 1/4 tone higher. This means that any fractional key number value .5 or greater that musx sends to the midi file on channel 0 will be automatically routed to the second channel in the pair (channel 1). A microdivs of 16 will claim all 16 channels in order to produce microtones so the only channel available for instrument assignment will be channel 0.
