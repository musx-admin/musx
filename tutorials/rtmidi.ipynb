    "\n",
    "The python-rtmidi package provides support for reading and writing MIDI messages to and from MIDI ports. The package is based on the rtmidi C++ project, which is itself a sub project of a larger audio framework called [STK](https://github.com/thestk/stk) (Synthesis Tool Kit) developed by Prof. Gary Scavone at Stanford and McGill. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the python-rtmidi package do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python -m pip install python-rtmidi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- When pip installs rtmidi it will attempt to compile C++ sources as part of the process so make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. If you are on a Mac with Xcode the python-rtmidi package should install without problems. On Windows, you may need to [follow these directions](https://spotlightkid.github.io/python-rtmidi/install-windows.html) to get the C++ code to build. You can also install rtmidi using the Anaconda package. -->\n",

    "### Installing REAPER for realtime playback\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Download and install [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Launch REAPER and open its Preferences window (Command-,).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In the Preferences panel, open the Audio section and click on the MIDI Devices tab.\n",

    "4) **ON THE MAC:** In the MIDI hardware panel that opens on the right side of the window, double click the line \"Apple Inc. -IAC Driver - Bus 1\", then click the \"Enable input from this device\" toggle button and select OK. (If you want to add a MIDI keyboard controller as an additional additional device you follow the exact same procedure again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) If you are not on a Mac then add whatever MIDI input port is available and remember to open that port in python as your output port.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Back in the main REAPER window, use the app's menu bar and select the Track>Insert virtual instrument on new track... command.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **ON THE MAC:** In the dialog window that opens, type DLS in the textbox at the top of the window -- you will then see a line \"AUi:DLSMusicDevice (Apple)\"  in the list box on the right of the dialog. Click the Add button in the dialog to add the DLS device to your track.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8) If you are not on a Mac, use whatever synth you have available. For purposes of this course it would be best if the synth were multitimbral, e.g. a sampler, or orchestral synth.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) After you click Add in (step 7) you may see the synth's editor window pop up. Don't mess with this,  just close it by clicking on the window's close button.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Reaper should now be able to play any MIDI messages you send to it on the IAC Driver Bus or whatever input port you opened."
