    "\n",
    "Supercollider is a powerful synthesis program and coding environment. The SuperCollider app is built on a client-server model with two-way communication between the SuperCollider language (sclang) and it's sound server (scsynth). This communication is implemented using the OSC protocol.  The OSC protocol, in turn, makes it very easy for external environments such as Python to send audio commands to SuperCollider for realtime playback.<superscript>**</superscript>\n",
