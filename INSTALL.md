# Installing musx

This document explains how to install musx in a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).  A virtual environment is an independent Python installation dedicated to a specific project (such as musx) without affecting your computer's global Python environment.  Highly recommended!

0. The musx package requires Python 3.9 or higher.  You can download the most recent releases of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once downloaded, double-click the installation package to install Python on your computer.

1. Open your computer's terminal application, create a directory dedicated to working with musx, then cd into your new workspace. (Note: the `$` represents your terminal's prompt, do not include it as part of your command!):

  ``` 
  $ mkdir ~/projects/mymusx
  $ cd ~/projects/mymusx
  ```

2. Call Python 3.10 or higher and create a virtual environment for  musx. You can use any name, this document calls it *musxenv* :

  ``` 
  $ python3.10 -m venv musxenv
  ```

3. Activate the musxenv virtual environment. Once activated you will see the name of the environnment prepended to your terminal's prompt:

  ```
  $ source musxenv/bin/activate
  (musxenv) $
  ```

4. With musxenv activated you can now use the generic 'python' command to invoke the correct Python version for the environment:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python
   Python 3.10.6 (v3.10.6:9c7b4bd164, Aug  1 2022, 17:13:48) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> quit()
   (musxenv) $
  ```

5. Next, make sure the musxenv environment uses the latest versions of pip, setuptools and wheel:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  ```

6. Install the musx support packages [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/), and [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/).  This will take a minute or two...

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python -m pip install matplotlib scipy jupyter lxml
  ```

7. Associate the musxenv environment name with your jupyter kernel so you can select musxenv as the notebook's kernel when you run musx demos and tutorials in jupyter notebooks.  The jupyter kernel will inform you where it saves the kernel spec should you want to edit its properties further:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=musxenv
  Installed kernelspec musxvenv in /Users/taube/Library/Jupyter/kernels/musxenv
  ```

8. Finally, install musx and (optionally) copy its support directories into your mymusx working directory for easy access:

  ```
(musxenv) $ python -m pip install musx

(musxenv) $ cp -r musxenv/site-packages/musx/doc ./doc

(musxenv) $ cp -r musxenv/site-packages/musx/demos ./demos

(musxenv) $ cp -r musxenv/site-packages/musx/tutorials ./tutorials


  ```

9. To test that musx is working, start up python, import the musx package, and call a function:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python
  Python 3.10.6 (v3.10.6:9c7b4bd164, Aug  1 2022, 17:13:48) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import musx
  >>> musx.keynum('C4')
  60
  >>> exit()
  (musxenv) $
  ```
___

That's it! ðŸ¤—  The best way to learn about the musx system is to read the documentation in the docs/ folder and run the scripts in demos/ and tutorials/.  To run a demo, you can use the jupyter notebook version or the python script version:

Run a Jupyter notebook demo:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ jupyter notebook demos/gamelan.ipynb
  ```

Run a Python script demo:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ python -m demos.gamelan
  ```

When you are done with your musx session you can type 'deactivate' to shut down your virtural environment. Once deactivated your terminal prompt will no longer display the virtual envronment name:

  ```
  (musxenv) $ deactivate
  $ 
  ```

## Additional support and customizations

* Install a good editor/IDE for coding Python. Here are two excellent free choices:

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
  - [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with the [free student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

* You will probably want to be able to play midi files directly from the terminal.  [fluidsynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) is a good choice, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install it on mac, linux, and windows:

  ```
  $ brew install fluid-synth
  ```

  Once installed, you will need to give fluidsynth a sound font to use, for example the free [MuseScore_General.sf3](ftp://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/musescore/soundfont/MuseScore_General/MuseScore_General.sf2).

  After downloading the sound font move it to a permanent location on your hard drive, e.g. /usr/local/soundfonts, and then pass that pathname to fluidsynth when you play a midi file:

  ```
  $ mv MuseScore_General.sf3 /usr/local/soundfonts
  $ fluidsynth -iq -g2 /usr/local/soundfonts/MuseScore_General.sf3 mymidifile.mid
  ```

  Since that command is pretty long you might want to add an alias to your .bashrc (or whatever) file:

  ```
  $ alias fs="fluidsynth -iq -g2 /usr/local/soundfonts/MuseScore_General.sf3"
  ```

  With that alias in effect, to play a midi file you just type:

  ```
  $ fs mymidifile.mid
  ```
