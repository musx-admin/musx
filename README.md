# musx
musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a package for composing and processing symbolic
music information. It was originaly created for teaching my CS+Music classes
and it now contains all the compositional tools developed in my Common Music
and Grace systems, including support for complex pattern generation, randomness,
mapping, enveloping, spectral composition, and microtonality. The 'base' musx
package provides a back end to read/write midi files and MusicXML; to compose
with audio files or send/receive real time midi or osc, see the 'Additional
support and customizations' section of
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/musx-admin/musx/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

musx requires the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/),
[numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/),
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
and [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/) packages.

[tutorials](https://github.com/musx-admin/musx/tree/main/tutorials), 
and [demos](https://github.com/musx-admin/musx/tree/main/demos)
