# musx
musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a package for composing and processing symbolic music information. It contains a large set of compositional tools adapted from my Common Music and Grace packages, including support for complex pattern generation, randomness, spectral composition,  microtonality, mapping & scaling, enveloping, etc.  musx already provides a back end to read and writes midi files and  the user can easily add their own backends to output to different systems, e.g.,  Csound, SuperCollider, portmidi, etc. See the demos package for a few examples.

To learn more about the system first read INSTALL.md, then look over the [musx documentation](docs/musx) and try out the examples in the [demos folder](demos/).
