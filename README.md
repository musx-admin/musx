# musx
musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a package for composing and processing symbolic music information. It contains a large set of compositional tools adapted from my Common Music and Grace packages, including support for complex pattern generation, randomness, spectral composition,  microtonality, mapping & scaling, enveloping, etc.  musx provides a back end to read and write midi files and the user can easily add their own backends to connect to different systems,  for example sending data to Csound, SuperCollider, portmidi, etc. See the musx/demos package for lots of examples.

If you are new to musx or Python start by following the directions in INSTALL.md, then try some examples in the [demos folder](demos/) and browse the [documentation](docs/musx/index.html).
