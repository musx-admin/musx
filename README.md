# musx
musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a package for composing and processing symbolic music information. It contains a large set of compositional tools adapted from my Common Music and Grace packages, including support for complex pattern generation, randomness, spectral composition,  microtonality, mapping & scaling, enveloping, etc.  musx provides a back end to read and writes midi files and the user can easily add their own backends to output to different systems,  for example  Csound, SuperCollider, portmidi, etc. See the musx/demos package for lots of examples.

If you are new to musx or Python start by following the directions in INSTALL.md, then try out some examples in the [demos folder](demos/) and read the [documentation](docs/musx/index.html).
