"""
musx (pronounced *muse ex*) is a package for composing and processing symbolic
music information. It contains a large set of compositional tools adapted from
my Common Music and Grace systems, including support for complex pattern
generation, randomness, mapping, enveloping, spectral composition, and 
microtonality. The musx package currently provides back ends to read and write
midi files and Csound (thank you Michael Gogins!) and it is straightforward
to add other backends to connect to different systems, for example to send
data to an app via portmidi or to SuperCollider via osc. If you are new to
musx or Python the place to start is by reading this documentation and
trying out the material in the demos directory. After restoring the demos,
you can generate output by running them as scripts:

```bash
python3 -m demos.gamelan
```
